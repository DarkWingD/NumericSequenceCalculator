# NumericSequenceCalculator-

Hey there!

Here is my solution to the Numeric Sequence Calculator task.

I have created an MVC web app, that includes unit tests, automated UI tests and this readme file. As you have discovered I have also saved the project to this github repository.

This is the first time I have done unit testing or automated UI testing in a long time. I tried Selenium but found it a little frustraiting, so then I tried WatIn and found it really simple and well integrated into the dom. I wasn't sure how to distinguish UI tests against unit tests as far as naming goes, so I put UI infront of the UI tests.

Hopefully the project will be easy enough to run. I used VS 2015 with nuget packages.

Thank you for your time, and I would appreciate any feedback on my work!

Instructions:
1) Once the page is loaded, you will see a text box near the middle of the screen with the text "Enter a number and hit "GO"" above it.
Type into that text box a number that is positive and less than 9999999
2) Click the button "GO" directly below the textbox.

Please observe the loading icon on the button, this indicates that we are processing your calculations so please be patient.

3a) If you entered an invalid number, there should be a red warning message below the text box informing what is wrong with your number, please start from step 1 again.
3b) If you entered a valid number, your results will be displayed. Each section is broken up by a the title of the calculation made, and the list of calculated results.
